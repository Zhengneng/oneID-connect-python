Installation for Ubuntu
=======================

oneID-py depends on two external libraries, cryptography.io and openSSL.
cryptography.io is a library that exposes cryptographic primitives from
openSSL.

`oneid-connect` should build easily on most Linux distributions that
have a C compiler, openSSL headers and the `libffi` libraries.

    $ sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python-dev

You should now be able to install `oneid-connect` with the usual

    $ pip install oneid-connect
